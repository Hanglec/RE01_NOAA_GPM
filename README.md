RE02

This repository includes the Python code for our paper "Machine learning approaches for improving near-real-time IMERG rainfall estimates by integrating Cloud Properties from NOAA CDR PATMOSX" (under peer review).

All the codes have been submitted and processed data will be provided after article published. Also, raw data can be avaliable freely by runing the function "GEE_download" in the code "Data_processed.py".

Under construction. Will come back soon...
